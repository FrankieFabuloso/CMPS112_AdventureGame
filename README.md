Final Project for CMPS112 comparative programing languages.

Description:

Final project required us to write the same program in a OO languane and Purely Fuctional language. Our team decided on Jave and Hasekll â€“ one that we were all very confident and familiar with and another one that we had been learning in class to further explore the strengths and limitations on purely fuctional languages. We decided on a very classic project, a text based Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Game, cause some people in the team had done it before and we though it would be a lot of fun.
