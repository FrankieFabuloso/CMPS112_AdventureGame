Steps to run EK4:
- 	set up your desired haskell compiler environment ( we used ghci on our terminal )
- 	load the Adveture.hs file via comand :l Adveture.hs 
- 	run the main functions via typing "main" on prompt window
- 	Ta-dah! You have now engaged in an exiting space text adveture!

Tips: 
- 	this impementations needs you to type all comands in ALL CAPS. So to go to 
  	the kitchen type "KITCHEN" not "kitchen"
- 	to check your health or potions at any time just type "STATUS". Be weary of your
  	moves, every move results in -5 hp due to fatigue! Reach 0 hp and you lose.
